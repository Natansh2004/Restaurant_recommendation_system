# This is the Restaurant recommendation system using content based filtering. This model will basically recommend the top 5 similar restaurants. Also I have used streamlit for creating frontend. So, basically, user can search any restaurant from the given list of around 3000 restaurants in bangalore, and according to the restaurant that the user has selected, this recommendation system will recommend top 5 similar restaurants with their respective URLs. This recommendation system is only applicable for restaurants in Bangalore, because the best suitable dataset that I found on Kaggle, was of Bangalore restaurants. I have used techniques like text vectorisation and cosine similarity in this project...
